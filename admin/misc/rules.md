in #meetings at least 1 day in advance.
Meeting host will send out a reminder in #meetings the morning of the meeting (ideally before 12:00PM PST).

### 4) General Responsibilities for All Team Members

This element of the team working agreement is the list of rules/agreements or the contract that all members agrees to live by.
- Finish weekly tasks in a timely manner.
  - If you run into issues completing your task, it is your duty to ask for help from the rest of the group.
- Respond to Slack regularly (within 12 hours).
- If you cannot attend meetings, give prior notice (at least 1 day in advance, with your reason) and create notes for what you did that week.
- Be respectful and accepting of your team members. 


### 5) Conflict Resolution

Each team should have an agreed-upon approach to addressing issues that may arise. 
For example, if a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team agrees to do X [specific action decided by the team] 
to address the problem before bringing the issue to a TA or professor.
If the issue is with one person: send them a message on Slack.
If the issue involves multiple people/above issue persists: bring up the issue in a meeting.
If the issue persists: bring the issue to a TA/professor.

For urgent issues: send a message in #urgent.

### 6) Expectations of Faculty and TAâ€™s

If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff after conflict resolution methods have  been applied, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
