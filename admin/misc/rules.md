### 2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

State your team’s agreed upon various means of communication and expectations for response. 
(Example: All members will be expected to read emails from anyone in the group on a daily basis and respond in not more than 12 hours.)

### 3) Scheduling Meetings

Agreed upon means of scheduling meetings. 
(Example: Team will agree, at the end of each class, to set any meetings times and agenda needed before the next class and beyond if possible. 
Team members will take turns to send out a reminder of the meeting with an agenda within eight hours after the class.)

### 4) General Responsibilities for All Team Members

This element of the team working agreement is the list of rules/agreements or the contract that all members agrees to live by.

### 5) Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines

This section may be used to record specific tasks or responsibilities particular team members have assumed.

### 6) Conflict Resolution

Each team should have an agreed-upon approach to addressing issues that may arise. 
For example, if a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team agrees to do X [specific action decided by the team] 
to address the problem before bringing the issue to a TA or professor.

### 7) Expectations of Faculty and GTA’s

Suggested Statement:
If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, 
but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.

### 8) Team Signatures

Include signature for each student.
Reminder -- each member should add their version named as /admin/misc/rules-studentname.pdf and it should include a signed version of the printed rules.
