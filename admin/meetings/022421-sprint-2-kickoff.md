**Location:** Zoom

**Date:** 02/24/21, 7:00 PM

## Attendance

**Present:** Eric, Yuchen, Tom, Ainesh, Jaslina, Justin, Neel, Sujan, Andrew

**Absent:** None

## Current Objective
Redesign interface and assign tasks for sprint 2.

## Tasks

### Unresolved Tasks/Updates from last week
* Tasklist and Timer still need to be merged -- accept PRs

### Current Tasks
* Everyone -- redesign interface
  *  Design team -- create high-fidelity design from wireframes, start styling CSS/etc
*  Tasks assigned (refer to decisions below)

### Undiscussed Tasks
* More discussion regarding design

## Decisions
* Icons vs. text for nav bar -- chose icons (looks cleaner)
* Icons vs text for pomo button -- chose text (too hard to describe functionality w/o text)
* "Done" button -- use check icon (over checkbox, empty box) -- looks clean and intuitive to click on
* Current pomo count (of session, not task) -- # or "status", and where? => Status, more immediately useful for user
  *  Under timer => More cohesive than bottom of page
*  Tasklist
  *  Number next to task name or in separate "column"? => In separate column -- readability
  *  How to handle long tasks? => hard character limit on task name length
  *  Remove button -- text or icon? => garbage can vector icon
  *  Add task -- text box entry at bottom of page (in line w/ tasks), suggested inputs "new task name", "1"
*  More flexibility w/ groups -- tasklist/timer integration is more urgent
*  Group Assignments
  *  Timer/Tasklist -- merging to main, debugging, timer -- debugging/integration, tasklist -- movable tasks, tracking current pomo # for task, integrating together
  *  Design/Nav Bar -- Create high fidelity design mock, implement nav bar CSS/HTML/JS
  *  Stats -- collecting finished tasks and displaying them
  *  Yuchen/Eric -- timer/tasklist
  *  Jaslina/Neel/Justin -- Design/Nav Bar
  *  Tom/Sujan/Andrew/Ainesh -- Stats/TTL crisis if needed

**End time:** 8:30 PM
