# 031521 Standup

## Eric Song
- **Progress:** README mostly finished, reviewed some PRs, fixed lints in others, added 3 self-hosted runners (on the same machine, so don't expect too much from them)
- **Upcoming tasks:** Help where needed w/ merging and testing, debug JSDoc workflow
- **Blocks:** Self-hosted runner being a pain, finals and studying

Missing: Jaslina, Tom, Yuchen, Sujan, Justin, Andrew, Neel, Ainesh
