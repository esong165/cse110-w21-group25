  * Main page, settings page -- keep clutter separate
  * Enter tasks & estimate # of Pomodoros - display current task (or "break" during breaks) under timer
  * Automatically transition btwn Pomodoro/breaks (as opposed to manual)
* Simple Skeleton
  * Pomodoro (25 minutes)
  * Short break (5 minutes)
  * Long break (10 minutes - every 4 pomodoros)
  * Task list - task + estimated pomodoros - sets up pomodoros for you
    * History - past tasks, estimated pomodoros, actual pomodoros 
  * Start button
  * "Clear task" - clear remaining pomodoros for task
