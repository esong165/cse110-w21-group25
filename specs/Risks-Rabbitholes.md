# Risks and Rabbit Holes

When creating an application like this, it is always necessary to clear or state any rabbit holes/risks that are associated.

One rabbit hole is that we needed to find a way to communicate what we have completed/not completed in a way that helps others. If this problem was not solved, we would have people wasting time and effort
looking and asking for solutions to problems that they would have the answer to immedietly. In order to solve this, we implemented a new channel in our Slack group dedicated
to updates. At the end of each day, each team member places what they have done, what they are working on, and if there was a complication or not. This way, we have daily
scrum meetings and places information on the completion of our various parts in an easily accessable place.

Another rabbit hole exists when talking about the design of the timer. Most of us, seeing the simplicity of the timer, brainstromed many complicated implementations. Seeing that this could lead to a variety of rabbit holes, such as
placing team members in unecessary situations of stress, we have decided to create a baseline version of our timer with individual elements that can be completed
by anyone on the team. This gives us a baseline of what to accomplish before moving onto larger and unnecessary elements of our very initial design, and allows everyone
on the team to feel assurance that everyone else on the team can help with everything. This also alliviates the rabbit hole that the items that we have decided to design may
not integrate or be realistic. By knowing what and how to do everything we have decided to compelete, we no loger are considering design solutions that do not exist.

Finally, we understand that there may be upcoming issues relating to the completion of the timer that may not been thought about initially. Dealing with issues without any structure
as to how to deal with them can also lead to a massive halt in our groups work. In order to solve this, along with time that we have set aside eachmeeting in order to debug/
solve our code, we have created a time-limit on the responses to questions posed by group members. By making sure that every member is able to get a timely response (within 24h)
we believe that we have essentially extended our time-solving time to throughout the week. Thus most group members will find out about the problem and have ample time before
the next meeting in order to make our problem-solving time more efficient.

Overall, our goal is to create as elegant and useful of a Pomodoro Timer as possible, and we that there will be issues both on the technical and managerial sides. By creating/
outlining these particular rabbit holes, we hope to have cleared or highlighted these concerns for the future.
