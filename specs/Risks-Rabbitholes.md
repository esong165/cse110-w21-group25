# Risks and Rabbit Holes

When creating an application like this, it is always necessary to clear or state any rabbit holes/risks that are associated.

One rabbit hole is that we needed to find a way to communicate what we have completed/not completed in a way that helps others. If this problem were not solved, we would have people wasting time and effort
looking and asking for solutions to problems that they would have the answer to immediately. In order to solve this, we implemented a new channel in our Slack group dedicated
to updates. At the end of each day, each team member places what they have done, what they are working on, and if there was a complication or not. This way, we have daily
scrum meetings and information on the completion of our various parts in an easily accessable place.

Another rabbit hole exists when talking about the design of the timer. Most of us, seeing the simplicity of the timer, brainstormed many complicated implementations. Seeing that this could lead to a variety of rabbit holes, such as
placing team members in unnecessary situations of stress, we have decided to create a baseline version of our timer with individual elements that can be completed
by anyone on the team. This gives us a baseline of what to accomplish before moving onto larger and unnecessary elements of our very initial design, and allows everyone
on the team to feel assurance that everyone else on the team can help with development. This also alleviates the concern that the items that we have decided to design may
not integrate well or be within a realistic scope. By knowing what to do and prototyping more complex features, we are simplifying the design process to reduce risk.

Finally, we understand that there may be upcoming issues relating to the completion of the timer that may not have been thought about initially. Dealing with issues without any structure
as to how to deal with them can also lead to a massive halt in our group's work. In order to solve this, along with time that we have set aside each meeting for debuging/testing code, we have created a time limit on the responses to questions posed by group members. By making sure that every member is able to get a timely response (within 24h)
we seek to lessen the impact of a single person running into a block early into a work cycle. Thus, most group members will find out about the problem and have ample time before
the next meeting in order to make our problem-solving time more efficient.

Overall, our goal is to create as elegant and useful of a Pomodoro Timer as possible, and we acknowledge that there will be issues both on the technical and managerial sides. By
outlining these particular rabbit holes, we hope to remain aware of these concerns as we progress.
