# Prototype 1

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide on what to implement in the first prototype.
What features should be included?

## Considered Options

* Timer display
* Timer button(s)
* Current Task
* Task List
* Settings
* Statistics 

## Decision Outcome

- Timer display, 3 time interval buttons, current task will be implemented because:
  - Core functionality to Pomodoro timer
- Others will be added as extra features, because: 
  - Unnecessary to core Pomodoro technique, though can perhaps be useful
