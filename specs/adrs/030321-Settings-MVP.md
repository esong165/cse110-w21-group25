# Settings MVP

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide on the features for our Settings page in the MVP.
Which features should we include as core functionality?

## Considered Options

* Customize timer intervals (within ranges)
* Change text display to minutes and seconds, or just seconds
* Show/hide text or animated timer
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Voiceovers
* Languages/localization
* Different color themes

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options: "custom timer intervals, change text display", because:
- Relatively simple to implement and relatively noticeable features
- Animated timer is not fully implemented yet, would create unnecessary block/dependency on other peoples' work to progress
- Accessibility features can be quality of life features we include as/after we catch up on testing/polishing the app
