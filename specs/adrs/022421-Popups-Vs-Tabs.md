# Popups Vs. Tabs

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to reconsider how to display the different sections of the page.
What is the best way to do this?

## Considered Options

* Popups/Modals
* Tabs with navigation bar

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Tabs with navigation bar", because:
- Popups still feel a little disruptive
- Popups are annoying if used too often
- Tabs with divs give a similar experience without the annoyances
