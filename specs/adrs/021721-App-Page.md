# App Page

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to host our app on GitHub Pages, but this will conflict with our team page.
What should we do to resolve the conflict?

## Considered Options

* Migrate team page to Wiki, workflow for GH-Page deployment via separate gh-pages branch
* Find other host for app page

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Migrate team page to Wiki, workflow for GH-Page deployment via seperate gh-pages branch", because:
- Free
- Team page looked very similar to Wiki page
