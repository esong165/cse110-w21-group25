# Sprint Review Location

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to hold a sprint review after the conclusion of the first sprint.
Where should we hold this meeting?

## Considered Options

* Retrium
* Zoom
* Slack (Asynchronous)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Zoom", because:
- We want the meeting to be synchronous
- Retrium tools are more useful for a formal retrospective
- We will only be summarizing progress for/reflecting on the sprint -- no need for specialized tools for this ceremony
