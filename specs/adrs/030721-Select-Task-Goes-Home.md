# Select Task Goes Home

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to consider what should occur after a user selects a task.
Should a user be left on the tasklist tab, or should they be brought back to the timer tab?

## Considered Options

* Leave on tasklist tab on select
* Bring back to timer tab on select

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Leave on tasklist", because:
- If a user is selecting a task, they know which task will be selected
- Even if they forget, the current task is displayed on the timer page
- Makes removing the selected task more streamlined/easier
