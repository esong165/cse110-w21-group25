# Stats MVP

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide what our Stats page will contain for the minimum viable product.
Which features should it contain?

## Considered Options

* History of completed stats
* Estimated vs. actual pomo sessions for each task
* Average # of pomodoros per task
* Number of "end/stop session" events for the current user
* Reset stats

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "History, estimated vs. actual pomos, average", because:
- Relatively simple to implement
- Basic features we need to have in order for it to feel like a "stats" page
