# Standups

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to update other team members with our current daily progress.
What would be the most effective format/platform for updates?

## Considered Options

* Locations:
  * Direct to repository
  * Slack
  * Miro
  * Email
* Format:
  * Planned tasks for the day
  * Daily progress
  * Upcoming tasks
  * Blocks
* When:
  * Every morning before noon
  * Every day before midnight

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options: "Slack", "Progress/upcoming tasks/blocks", "Every day before midnight" because:
- Most accessible to all team members, fastest response time
  - Can commit every day's collection of updates at the end of the day/week
- Updating with upcoming tasks helps with planning
- We can make sure enough people are working on each task
- People may not be awake before noon or could be busy with classes
- Updating with "planned tasks" is less useful than knowing what got done, "upcoming tasks" serves the same function
- Blocks can be addressed quickly
- Standup notes are required for the course
