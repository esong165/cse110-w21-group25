# Sprint 1 Goal

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to determine the goals for our first sprint.
What will be our desired outcome for this sprint?

## Considered Options

* Just a timer
* Timer with tasklist
* Timer with tasklist with stats/history
* Timer with tasklist with settings
* Timer with tasklist with stats with settings

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Timer with tasklist", because:
- Two of the main features to our Pomodoro app
- Other functionality would be nice to have, but not essential
- Many members had external factors limiting their ability to contribute to the project
