# Timer Button

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide on the most optimal way for users to input timer cycles.
What style of user input is most suitable?

## Considered Options

* Three timer buttons for start pomo (changes to fail task during session), short break, long break
* Single button which changes between all 3 timer intervals
* Dial for user to rotate to desired time interval

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Single Button", because:
- Clear to user what their next session will be
- Dial could be somewhat "gimmicky"/too hard to implement within time frame
- 3 Buttons provides clutter
