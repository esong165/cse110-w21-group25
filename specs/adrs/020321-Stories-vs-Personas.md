# Stories vs Personas

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide on starting with user stories or personas for our project pitch.
Which one should we create first?

## Considered Options

* User stories
* Personas

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Personas", because:
- User stories can simply be added as GitHub issues
- Personas give us a better image of a userbase and the different use possibilities
- Most of the team found the specificity of user stories more awkward to write
- Personas add more "flavor" to the problems which need to be addressed
- We will use the personas in order to frame/phrase our user stories
