# Retrospective Location

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to hold a Sprint 1 retrospective after the conclusion of the first sprint, after the review meeting.
What technologies should we use to hold this ceremony?

## Considered Options

* Slack
* Zoom
* Retrium

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options: "Retrium + Zoom", because:
- Easiest to communicate with each other on call rather than in Slack channels
- Retrium was the Retrospective tool suggested by the professor
- Anonymity and basic structure presented by Retrium helps guide discussion towards important topics
