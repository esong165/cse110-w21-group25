# Reorganize Tasks

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide how a user would be able to organize tasks.
How should a user be move tasks after inputting them?

## Considered Options

* User cannot move tasks in tasklist
* Move up/down button on side of tasklist
* Draggable section for user to move the task around

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Draggable", because:
- Being unable to reorganize the tasklist without re-entering everything will be frustrating for an end user
- To us, dragging tasks around feels the most natural/smooth/fast
- Clicking a move up/down button many times may feel tedious/needlessly time-consuming
