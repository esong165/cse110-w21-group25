# E2E Testing

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to test the components of our code, specifically web components, in a way that better resembles an end user's interaction with the site.
What would be a useful tool to achieve this type of testing?

## Considered Options

* Cypress
* Manual testing
* Other testing tools

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Cypress", because:
- Manual testing with outside sources takes longer and is more suited to a more complete product
- Manual testing by ourselves is not very productive because we are very familiar with the app
- Out of all of the tools, we are most familiar with Cypress, as we have done a lab with it
