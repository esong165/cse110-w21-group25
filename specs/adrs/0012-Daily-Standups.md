# Daily Standups

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to outline how we document daily progress.
What would be the most efficient method?

## Considered Options

* Location
	* Slack
	* Zoom
	* Google Doc
	* Repo
* Time
	* Mornings (before noon)
	* Evenings (before midnight)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Standdowns posted to "Slack" at "Evenings" before midnight, updating on progress/upcoming tasks/blocks.
- Consistent participation more likely if done every night instead of every day
- Too many time conflicts for Zoom to be worthwhile, Slack is most accessible
- Standdowns at night are a good way to track what we have done for the day and plan for tomorrow
