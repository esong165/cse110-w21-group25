# Change Color in Different Modes

## Context and Problem Statement

How can we visually show the user that they are done with the pomo session?
Is just a sound timer enough? What if the sound on the computer is turned off?

## Considered Options

* Have something flashy on the screen to catch users attention
* Background color changes as mode changes

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Background color changes as mode changes", because:
- The background of the page is visible on every screen
- A change in background would be a noticible difference for the user, no matter where they are in the application
- Green signifies that a pomo is running
- Purple means short break
- Blue means long break
