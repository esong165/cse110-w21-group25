# Settings Vs. FAQ

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to consider how the page will be organized.
Should settings and FAQ be grouped together, or left separate?

## Considered Options

* Separate Settings/FAQ tabs
* Same tab for settings and FAQ

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Separate tabs", because:
- Settings and FAQ have different roles
- Lets settings page be less bulky
- Lets FAQ be static
