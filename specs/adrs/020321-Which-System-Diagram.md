# Which System Diagram

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide on which format of system diagram we should use.
Should we use C4 diagrams, event modeling diagrams, or UML form diagrams?

## Considered Options

* C4
* Event modelling
* UML

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "C4", because:
- Yuchen is familiar with C4
- C4 allows for us to create the more relevant (first 3 levels) parts now
- We can add to/edit more specific levels as we go easily
