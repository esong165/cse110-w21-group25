# Final Timer Display

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide on what the timer should display.
What types of ways should we convey the time to the user?

## Considered Options

* Text
* Animated timer
* Both

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options: "Both", because:
- Allows for customization and more options for an end user -- they can turn on/off any desired/undesired part to best suit their needs
- Animated timer can feel more intuitive to more visually-minded people
- Text-based timer can feel more intuitive to more "digitally"-minded people
