# Linting

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to lint our code style for consistency.
What tool should we use for this?

## Considered Options

* ESLint
* GitHub Super-Linter
* Manual

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "GitHub Super-Linter", because:
- Contains linters for html/css/md/js, including ESLint
- Manual review is inefficient
