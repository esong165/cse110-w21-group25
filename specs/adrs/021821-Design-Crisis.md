# Design Crisis

## Context and Problem Statement

We are running into major issues with our app's design/usability.
How should we finalize/clarify our app design?

## Considered Options

* Group planning on Miro
* Work with what we have for now
* "Pen and paper" sketch from everyone

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "pen and paper sketch from everyone", because:
- Helps us define any parts of the design that were unclear before
- Suggested by Sim
- Need to ensure everyone can express their ideas
	- Could help with catching issues someone had not noticed
- Iterating on current design is not working
