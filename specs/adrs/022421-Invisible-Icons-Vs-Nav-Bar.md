# Invisible Icons Vs. Navigation Bar

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to rethink the invisible icon design decided upon earlier.
Should we keep the invisible icon approach or move to another interface design?

## Considered Options

* Invisible icons
* Navigation bar with all buttons visible constantly

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Constantly visible navigation bar", because:
- Invisible icons might be disorienting for the user
  - Some of the buttons that would be hidden are significant features
- This lets us organize the page more cleanly
- Buttons that are disabled still offer minimal distraction, less tacky
