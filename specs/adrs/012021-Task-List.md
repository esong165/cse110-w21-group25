# Task List

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide on the functionality of a task list.
Which features should we include?

## Considered Options

* Task name
* Set predicted pomos
* Pomodoro History/data
* Add/delete tasks

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options: "Task names, set predicted pomodoro count, add/delete tasks", because:
- History/data is somewhat separate from core tasklist functionality
