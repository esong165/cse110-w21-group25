# Timer Prototype

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to create timer funcionality for our first sprint.
Which features should a timer have?

## Considered Options

* Timer display
* Set timer intervals
* Single button for controlling timer states
* Multiple buttons to control timer states
* Alarm and alert once timer hits 0

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: all but multiple buttons, because:
- Chosen features were all essential to an end user using a timer
- Single button is easier to use than multiple buttons
