# Platform For Planning

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to find a platform in which we can easily collaborate on project planning/brainstorming.
Where should we hold these planning meetings?

## Considered Options

* Zoom Screenshare/whiteboard
* Miro

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Miro", because:
- Can save information and edit it in the future
- More integrated tools for sketching out ideas/diagrams
- Professor Powell recommended it
