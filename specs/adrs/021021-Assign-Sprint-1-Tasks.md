# Assign Sprint 1 Tasks

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to create a prototype by the end of sprint 1.
How should we divide up the work?

## Considered Options

* Assign teams for timer/tasklist/CSS
* Assign individual tasks to each person
* Mob programming

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Assign teams for timer/tasklist/CSS", because:
- Too many scheduling conflicts for mob programming
- Not enough people at meeting to assign tasks to everyone reasonably
- Working in smaller groups minimizes bus factor (less individuals with all of the knowledge)
- Many people still occupied with their external concerns
