# FAQ MVP

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide on the features for our FAQ page in the MVP.
What kind of questions might a user ask?
What might the user need to know in order to use the application?

## Considered Options

* Describe step by step how to use the application
* Lengthy description for every tab
* Description of what is a Pomodoro Timer
* Place for user to add notes of their own (kind of like a mini notes/journal section)
* Describe every feature/button on the application separately
* Add credit to the creators of the icons used
* Short answers to common questions the user might have about how to use the app
* Assume the user can figure out simple/general funtionality on their own
* "short and sweet" FAQ page so as to not overwhelm the user

## Decision Outcome

Chosen choices and why:
1. Brief steps on how to use basic functions of the app
  - want it to be easy to read and a quick guide to the user to get started
  - doesn't explain all features - only the bare minimum, aka, what is necessary for basic user
2. Short descriptions of some of the tabs/features and what they do
  - wanted the user to be able to nagivate throughout the application
  - worded the questions more in terms of what the user might experience, instead of just creating sections dedicated to tabs
  - assume the user has used websites before and can figure out basic workings of the app w/o detailed descriptions
3. Credit to the icon creators
  - We did not create the icons and therefore needed to give credit to those who did
  - This page felt most appropriate place to do so
      - If a user is curious to know more about the "behind-the-scenes" of the app, like the icons, this is the page that makes to most sense to visit
4. Some additional questions relating to aspects of the app that may be less intuitive/more confusing
  - There are some things about the app that might be confusing, so we wanted to help the user where be can. Some of those are:
      - Why the background color changes
      - Why you cannot pause the timer
      - What to do if you need to end task early
      - What to do if you finish task early
5. What exactly is a Pomodoro Timer
  - Although most people visiting the page would probably already know what they are dealing with, we wanted to give some brief history/background knowlege/rules
  - Explains basic technique and why the times for each peice are as they are
