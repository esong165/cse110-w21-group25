# Icons Vs. Text

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide how to show information to the user.
Which elements should be shown with text, and which should be conveyed as icons?

## Considered Elements

* None
* Timer display
* Start/fail button
* Tasklist access
* Stats access
* Settings access
* Timer access
* Pomodoro phase display
* Task/Tasklist buttons
* Finish task button

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Displayed as icons: Task/tasklist buttons, stats/settings/timer/tasklist access, finish task button", because:
- These elements are simple enough and can be conveyed with relatively universal icons
- The other pieces of information have more nuance or more detailed info that cannot be easily conveyed as simple images
- When available (and when they do not sacrifice too much info), icons look better -- use text only when icons are insufficient
