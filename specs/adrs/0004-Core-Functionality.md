# Core Functionality

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide on our Pomodoro Timer's features.
What features should we include as core functionality?

## Considered Options

* Display running clock for time left
* Alarm/audio plays when time is up, changes pomodoro timer to current tab
* Task name
* Task list
* Settings
* History/data
* Display system time
* Mobile support
* Google extension
* FAQ/how to do Pomodoro cycles
* Place to track ideas/distractions which shows up after a cycle

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options: "alarm/audio/tab focus cue after timer ends, current task name, running clock for time left", because:
- Basic use cases for Pomodoro timer
- Other features will be possibilities for expansion once we get the timer working
- Too many "toys" for user to play with creates possible distraction/needless complexity
