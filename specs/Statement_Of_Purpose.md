# Statement of purpose

"Get Big and Huge", A wise man once said these words. We all know that size is the prize and swole is the goal, but how does one get there. How does one get to be the biggest and the hugest?
The answer is consistency, when one works a muscle we cannot simply work it max effort throughout one workout, we must work in way that allows us to exercise the muscle without getting into fatigue.
The easiest way to to break training into intervals, we can see this in training methods such as HIIT(High intensity interval training) or CrossFit. But these techniques may work in the gym, how do we get our **Brains** to become Big/Huge.

*So how do we implement interval training into our brains* Our solution is the Pomodoro Timer. Many people today are under the pressure of completing a project, that they do not realize it is not feasible to work 12 hours straight taking no breaks. To counteract this we use the Pomodoro timer a Interval timer where the user takes short or long breaks in between working sessions for a task we create a timer 

 1. Keeps track of tasks in pomo times
 2. Each pomo is 25 minutes where we work
 3. In between each pomo we take 5 minute breaks
 4. Every 4 breaks we take a long 15 minute break.

 By implementing the timer we want to:

 1. Improve User's efficiency when approaching tasks
 2. Create simple application that facilitates the ability to work smarter
 3. Reduce mental fatigue of the customer
 4. Make Big Brain
 
 We want to create a Pomodoro Timer to create the biggest, brightest, and hugest minds in the world. But taking into account the time limitations we have to consider what we can accomplish in this time frame. Our goal for this quarter is to get the basic implementation of the Pomodoro timer down, and a task list. 
 
 We hope that by the end of the quarter we will have created a timer that gets brains biggest, hugest, brightest.
